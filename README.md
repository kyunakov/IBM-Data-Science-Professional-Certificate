Since the README file is the first thing users see when they land on your repository, it is good practice to populate it with useful information to users. Using the pencil icon on the right, you can edit the README file and include, for example, a detailed description of the repository. You can also add special instructions or prerequisites to use the repository, and perhaps some examples of how to use the repository.
