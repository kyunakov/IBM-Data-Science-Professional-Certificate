    "**Berlin** is a great city for tourists. It is not a surprise that it is ranked as the most visited German city by <a href=\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-most-visited-cities-in-germany.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Worldatlas</a> with 31.1 milion tourists for 2016. However, as a tourist, you may find it **diffucult** to find out in which part of the city you should spend most of your time while being in Berlin. Especially for the tourists visiting Berlin only for a day or a weekend. The city is really big and it is divided in 96 boroughs, full of great places to visit. The questions I will try to answer are:\n",
    "<p> <b>1) Which borough(s) has the highest variaty of venues? </b></p>\n",
    "<p> <b>2) What is the most common type of restaurants in Berlin? </b></p>\n",
    "<p> <b>3) Which borough(s) is near to Art Gallery? </b></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main audience which may benefit by answering the questions above is the **one-day tourists.** It will be extremely valuable for them to know in which district should they spend their only day in Berlin in order to get the best out of it and also to have more specific expectations from Berlin as a touristic destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this project the terms boroughs, neighborhoods and districts are used with the same meaning."

    "During the work for this project we noticed several important things:\n",
    "1. The API calls from Foursquare can be a very useful free tool to gather information for different cities, their venues and their distribution within the city. However, the limitation of the API calls for radios and number of venues return can falsify the results at the very end if you want to make a big aggragated analysis. If you want to get more detailed findings, you better use one of the paid options for Foursquare API calls. This will allow you to increase the radius of scan even more and at the same time to not have any overlapping in the scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The most center district in Berlin (Mitte) is the one that has the highest potential for spending a good short vacation in Berlin. Especially for the tourists that visit the city for a day or weekend. Even though this was a bit expected, now we can confirm that this is a valid assumption to make. It is also good to see that all of the districts in Berlin have at least one venue from the Foursquare database. This shows that the Foursquare can be considered a good source for relavant location data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The influence of the different culture in Berlin can be seen by the numerous different types of restaurants in Berlin. The fact that Italian restaurants are the most common type of restaurant can show us that probably the Italian cousina is the most favourite one to the majority of people living in Berlin. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Berlin is famous with it's countless art galleries and museums. One of the findings of this project that only a couple of central districts have a gallery. That was a fact that definately can guide the tourists who have an interest in art in which district they should go to."
